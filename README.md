# Personality_Drug_Project

This repository contains a data science project which implements different supervised machine learning models to predict drug abuse risk based on demographic and psychological factors. The following 8 classification algorithms were used for predictive modeling: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, XGBoost. 


In a second step, the modeling results were then applied to a (fictitious) business case in order to calculate health insurance premiums for potential customers based on their predicted drug abuse risks. 




Included in this repository are:
- A Business Presentation slide deck of this project in PDF format (with speaker notes): **Health_Insurance_Premium_Presentation.pdf**
- A Jupyter Notebook presenting all steps of the data science life cycle, including a demonstration of the final business application: **Health_Insurance_Premium.ipynb**
- The dataset used for supervised machine learning: **drug_consumption.csv**
- The research articles on which the dataset is based (Fehrman et al., 2017): **Personality_Drug_Paper_long.pdf**, **Personality_Drug_Paper_short.pdf**
